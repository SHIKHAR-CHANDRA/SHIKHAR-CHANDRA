### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Shikhar, an undergrad Electronics and Communication engineering student. 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my final year project with Collins Aerospace for development of an avionics protocol analyzer. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning open source tools for information sciences and quantum computing
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on wireless communication and microwave engineering research projects
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love playing chess and badminton!

Besides being an avid researcher in fields of Communication Engineering, I am also a keen Space Enthusiast.

### Hi there 👋

I am Shikhar, an undergrad Electronics and Communication engineering student. 


- 🔭 I’m currently working on my final year project focussed on Metasurfaces for Stealth Applications
- 🌱 I’m currently learning open source tools for information sciences and quantum computing
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on wireless communication and microwave engineering research projects
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love playing chess and badminton!

Besides being an avid researcher in fields of Communication Engineering, I am also a keen Space Enthusiast.
